# KPF-Instances
Our manuscript, titled "A Hybrid BRKGA Applied to the Knapsack Problem with Forfeits" utilized benchmark instances initially introduced by Dr. Cerulli (raffaele@unisa.it) and generously provided by Dr. Andrea Raiconi (araiconi@unisa.it).

Upon the publication of our paper, we will make the source code for the proposed Q-HBRKGA algorithm publicly available.
